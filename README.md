# Predicting-Heart-Diesease
This project focuses on creating an accurate heart disease prediction system using machine learning models: Logistic Regression, KNN, SVM, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and XGBoost. Early diagnosis is crucial, making these models essential for predicting heart disease likelihood.

## Overview
This project aims to develop a robust and accurate heart disease prediction system utilizing various machine learning algorithms. Predicting the likelihood of heart disease is of paramount importance for early diagnosis and intervention. The following machine learning models will be employed to achieve this goal:

#### *Logistic Regression:
A fundamental model for binary classification, Logistic Regression is well-suited for predicting the probability of an individual having heart disease based on input features.

#### *K-nearest Neighbors (KNN):
KNN, a non-parametric and instance-based learning algorithm, will be employed to identify patterns in the dataset by comparing the features of a given individual to its k-nearest neighbors.

#### *Support Vector Machine (SVM):
SVM, a powerful classification algorithm, will be used to separate individuals with and without heart disease by finding an optimal hyperplane in the feature space.

#### *Decision Trees Classifier:
Decision Trees offer interpretability and are effective for complex decision-making. This model will recursively partition the dataset to make predictions regarding heart disease status.

#### *Random Forest Classifier:
Random Forest, an ensemble learning technique, will be employed to construct a multitude of decision trees and combine their predictions, resulting in a robust and accurate model.

#### *XGBoost Classifier:
XGBoost, an efficient and scalable gradient boosting algorithm, will be utilized to build an ensemble of weak learners, enhancing prediction accuracy and generalization.
